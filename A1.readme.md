# IRC Bot A1.0

Each bot needs a small set up :

- his bot's name
- his channel on irc.freenode.net
- your IRCBot script to be executed


The IRC-Bot (it has to be able to be executed on a RPi) has to connect securely to an IRC network, then join your channel. (Create your own channel on irc.freenode.net)
He will be using his bot's name as username (for example "RPi-Alpha").
Once on the channel, he delivers automatically a message contained in motd.txt
Then he will wait for command prompt (asked as "rpiname command", ie. "RPi-Alpha selfdestruct").
The 1st version will only make him answer "Hi %USER !" When someone will say his name followed by hello (not case sensitive).

<h3>Example :</h3>
motd.txt contains "Everything is right, looks like i'm connected !"
RPi-Alpha connect on irc.freenode.net, then join your own channel, and says : "Everything is right, looks like i'm connected !"
Then it waits for a msg saying "RPi-Alpha hello"
If someone with username=USER sends it, he will answer "Hi USER !"
