# IRC Bot A2.0

Each bot needs a small set up (and their associated variables (you can change their names)):

- his bot's name -> $name
- his channel on irc.freenode.net -> $channel
- a shell file listing commands -> commands.sh
- your IRCBot script to be executed

All features in Alpha-1 version have to be included (or built with the new command system)

<h3>Features added :</h3>

The Rpi wont anymore wait for "$name hello"
Now he will wait for "$name" and then catch the whole message he can read "$name" into.
Let's see how many informations we will have in a single message :

	- $name -> the name of the raspberry
	- command -> the command to be executed
	- argument1 -> the 1st argument
	- argument2 -> the 2nd argument
	- ...

so the rpi will wait for a message, lets imagine one arrives !

	- Case 1 : It's not my $name -> don't read the message, wait for the next
	- Case 2 : It's my $name ! What's the 2nd word ?
		-> It's "command" -> Then execute ./command.sh with first argument "command", and second argument a generated ID like 239753 (all remaining arguments in the IRC message will be added after this ID)
		-> Wait for the end of the command, then look if the file (in our example 239753) is empty
		Case YES : Just send that the command has been successfully executed and there's no output
		Case NO : Say command successfully executed too, but also send the file content 

<h3>Example :</h3>

commands.sh content :

	function run() {
		./$3  # That makes $3 (third arg) being executed
		echo "Done without error." > $2.out #that writes "Done without error." into $2 (second arg) path
	}

So now, let's imagine a concret case :

	ON IRC, CLIENT says : "RPi-Alpha run update.sh"
	THEN SERVER WILL RUN
	$ ./commands.sh run 975837 update.sh
	$ myAwesomeFunctionGivingNumberOfLinesInFile 975387.out
		=> 1 line in 975387.out
	$ myAwesomeFunctionSendindIrcMessages "Success"
	$ myAwesomeFunctionSendindIrcMessages 975387.out
	$ myAwesomeFunctionWaitingForAnotherIrcMessage

And again and again.
