# IRC Bot A4.0

Each bot needs a small set up (and their associated variables (you can change their names)):

- his bot's name -> $name
- his channel on irc.freenode.net -> $channel
- a shell file listing commands -> commands.sh
- a config file
- your IRCBot script to be executed

All features in Alpha-3 version have to be included

Your bot has to make regular check up to see if all is good.

	- Am I still connected to IRC Server ? (i.e PING command to another server if available, or PING the server (VIA IRC command))

If there's a problem, he will have to fix it (by restarting IRCBot or IRC connexion or ...), and to log this issue into a log file (i.e log.txt) preceed by date, and time.

You will upgrade your "motd" hello (the modt.txt you're sending at the start) and add a part with the log file.

	i.e "We found new logs :\n" + log.txt content

Then you will have to find a way to keep this log file content in a backup with initial date and time + when have they been sent; then you will have to remove the log file
