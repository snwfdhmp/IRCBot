# IRC Bot A3.0

Each bot needs a small set up (and their associated variables (you can change their names)):

- his bot's name -> $name
- his channel on irc.freenode.net -> $channel
- a shell file listing commands -> commands.sh
- your IRCBot script to be executed

All features in Alpha-2 version have to be included

This version will be the first build you will be able to share with co-worker

That's your goal. Make it easy to install. Make scripts that automate the installation of the current bot.

You can try that everything is working by trying on another empty RPi (has to be formatted after !!), or by formatting yours. (backup programm first :] )

You will also have to make a config file, with variables :

- path to commands file (commands.sh by default)
- RPi Name
- irc channel (default : your channel)

/!\ You don't have to make options for configuring IRC Server address and port, but feel free to do it if you want to.. /!\
